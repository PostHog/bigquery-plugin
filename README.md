# Google BigQuery Plugin

Send events to a BigQuery database on ingestion.

## Installation

1. Visit 'Plugins' in PostHog
1. Find this plugin from the repository or install `https://github.com/PostHog/bigquery-plugin`
1. Configure the plugin
   1. Upload your Google Cloud key `.json` file. (See below for permissions and how to retrieve this.)
   1. Enter your Dataset ID
   1. Enter your Table ID 
1. Watch events roll into BigQuery

## BigQuery permissions and service account setup

To set the right permissions up for the BigQuery plugin, you'll need:
1. A service account.
2. A dataset which has permissions allowing the service account to access it.

Here's how to set these up so that the PostHog plugin has access only to the table it needs:

1. [Create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication). Keep hold of the JSON file at the end of these steps for setting up the plugin, and remember the name too.

2. Create a role which has only the specific permissions the PostHog BigQuery plugin requires (listed below), or use the built in `BigQuery DataOwner` permission. If you create a custom role, you will need:
   * bigquery.datasets.get
   * bigquery.tables.create
   * bigquery.tables.get
   * bigquery.tables.list
   * bigquery.tables.updateData

3. Create a dataset within a BigQuery project (ours is called `posthog`, but any name will do).

4. Follow the instructions [on granting access to a dataset in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-access-controls#granting_access_to_a_dataset) to ensure your new service account has been granted either the role you created or the "BigQuery Data Owner" permission.

   Use the Share Dataset button to share your dataset with your new service account and either the `BigQuery DataOwner` role, or your custom role created above. In the below, we've used a custom role `PostHog Ingest`.

That's it! Once you've done the steps above, your data should start flowing from PostHog to BigQuery.

## Troubleshooting

### Duplicate events

There's a very rare case when duplicate events appear in BigQuery. This happens due to network errors, where the export seems to have failed, yet it actually reaches BigQuery.

While this shouldn't happen, if you find duplicate events in BigQuery, follow these [Google Cloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#manually_removing_duplicates) to manually remove the them.
